Prompt: what is log odd, odd in logistic regression

In logistic regression, we work with probabilities through the concepts of odds and log odds (also known as the logit).

Odds
The odds represent the ratio of the probability that an event will occur to the probability that it will not occur. If 
p is the probability of the event (e.g., success), then the odds are defined as:
For example, if p=0.8, then the odds are =4, meaning the event is 4 times as likely to occur than not.

Log Odds (Logit)
The log odds is simply the natural logarithm of the odds:

Interpretation of Coefficients
Coefficients (ùõΩ): Each coefficient in the model represents the change in the log odds for a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor variable.
Exponential of Coefficients: Taking the exponential of a coefficient, exp(Œ≤i), gives you the multiplicative change in the odds for a one-unit 
increase in the predictor Xi


Prompt: How to use pairplot for student.csv

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('student_data.csv')

# If the target column is named "Target", use that for hue; otherwise, adjust the column name.
sns.pairplot(data, hue='Target')
plt.suptitle('Pairplot of Student Data', y=1.02)
plt.show()


Prompt: How to plot and interpret confusion_matrix

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Assuming y_test (true labels) and y_pred (predicted labels) are already defined
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

                Predicted Negative    Predicted Positive
Actual Negative        TN (True Negative)    FP (False Positive)
Actual Positive        FN (False Negative)   TP (True Positive)

True Negatives (TN): The number of negative instances correctly predicted as negative.
False Positives (FP): The number of negative instances incorrectly predicted as positive.
False Negatives (FN): The number of positive instances incorrectly predicted as negative.
True Positives (TP): The number of positive instances correctly predicted as positive.


Prompt: What is gridsearch

Grid search is a systematic method for hyperparameter tuning where you define a grid (or set) of possible parameter values and then exhaustively train 
and evaluate the model using every combination from that grid. The goal is to find the best combination that yields the optimal performance based on a specified
metric (such as accuracy).

How Grid Search Works

1. Parameter Grid:
You specify a dictionary of parameters and the set of values to try for each parameter

2. Model Evaluation:
For each combination of parameters in the grid, the model is trained (often using cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate) and its performance is measured.

3. Selection:
After testing all combinations, the parameter set that produces the best performance metric is selected as the optimal configuration.
